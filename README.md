## Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project uses Python and machine learning techniques to predict the selling price of used cars based on historical vehicle data. It walks through the full machine learning pipeline, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the application of multiple regression algorithms. By analyzing features such as mileage, age, engine capacity, and performance metrics, the project aims to uncover the most impactful variables affecting car prices. The results help demonstrate how predictive models can support smarter pricing decisions in the used car market.
